Misc Reviews-Storefront notes

product.htm template
   • need to call magic method has_reviews()
   • need this in both the product and the user content (did jason add the user context)

misc:
   • need to know how to organize common/review.html code between template and markup builder functions
   • need to know how to incoroporate js
   • add $product::reviews() to SI_Storefront::get_product()
   • what is $params array in store controllers?
   • what is $params[’render’] and $params[’structured’]?
   • markup: Base vs. Factory vs. Renderable?

general operation:
   • SI_Storefront—>set_content loads markup builder class, creates new instance of markup builder factory of the content “type”, also gets builder for that type.
   • constructor of Markup Factory loads data that is comment to all templates of “type”
   • when to put stuff in common vs. store?
